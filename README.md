# Data structure AmongUs Mini problem

This project was made in an academic context in order to practice new concepts viewed in the Advanced Data Structure course.  This project deals with many concepts like : 
* AVL & Binary Search TREES 
* Graphs
* Floyd Warshall Algorithm
* Hamiltonian path  
<br>
Furthermore, this project was interesting to implement because it permitted us to discover a new trendy game called "Among Us".
